## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to help bootcamp students going through the Prework. This project contains notes (HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript) to help bootcamp students keep notes and practice code throughout the bootcamp. It helps bootcamp students feel organized. Using this Prework Study Guide, I have already learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
